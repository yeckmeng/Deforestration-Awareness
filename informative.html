            <h3> To explain more about deforestration </h3>
            <p> While preserving and conserving the natural forest increases biological diversity, deforestation causes habitat loss. The biological diversity of the natural forest supplied the basis for life on earth, including human existence, and it is a sure way to ensure that the world will be abundant for future generations. In essence, by protecting the forest, we ensure not only the survival of a number of other ecosystems but also the survival of the environment in which people live. By preserving the various distinguishing features and biological diversity of the forest, we can eventually benefit from the various forms of life that the forest supports in terms of food security, enhanced agriculture, leisure activities, and other benefits.</p>

            <h3> How can you support to prevent this? </h3>
            <p> There are multiple ways one can do to support and prevent deforestration from escalating any further, for deforestration due to use of wood, one in which consumer should use recycled items so there is less demand for newer raw materials from trees. For deforestration due to urbanizations and other relating, reforestration should be done as a process of replanting the trees back for once damaged areas as an effort to recover the well environment it once was.</p>
